The ball-box problem is as follows:

Suppose there are N boxes numbered 1 through N, and N balls numbered 1 through
N. How many ways can the balls be put into the boxes so that each ball's number
is different from its box's number?

The answer, times N!, is the number of possible first-two-columns of an N by
N Latin Square.
